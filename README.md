# GIVE-UP
GIVE-UP is a tool for exploring RNA-DNA interactions that result from the [iMARGI pipeline](https://sysbio.ucsd.edu/imargi_pipeline/). It is easier to implement than [GIVE](https://zhong-lab-ucsd.github.io/GIVE_homepage/), allowing a quick visualization of interactions. For more complex analyses, we recommend using GIVE instead.
